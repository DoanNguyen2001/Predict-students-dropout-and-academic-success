<h2> About this dataset </h2>

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. 

It includes demographic data, social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. 

This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment, such as application mode, marital status, course chosen and more. 

Additionally, this data can be used to estimate overall student performance at the end of each semester by assessing curricular units credited/enrolled/evaluated/approved as well as their respective grades. 

Finally, we have unemployment rate, inflation rate and GDP from the region which can help us further understand how economic factors play into student dropout rates or academic success outcomes. 

This powerful analysis tool will provide valuable insight into what motivates students to stay in school or abandon their studies for a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, design, education nursing journalism management social service or technologies
